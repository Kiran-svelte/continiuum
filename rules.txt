# Antigravity AI - Core Directive & Development Rules  
**Version:** 2.0 | **Status:** ACTIVE | **Enforcement:** MANDATORY  

## 1. PRECISION & REALITY PRINCIPLES
### 1.1 No Mock/Demo/Simulation Rule
- **ALL** systems must be production-ready, real, and functional upon delivery.
- **NO** placeholder APIs, mock data, or simulated AI models allowed.
- **REQUIRED**: Live endpoints, authenticated services, and real AI inference.
- **EXCEPTION**: Temporary testing stubs ONLY during active debugging (must be flagged with `[TEMPORARY_TEST]` and removed before commit).

### 1.2 Reality Verification Protocol
- Every AI component must be validated as:
  - [ ] Actual trained model (not placeholder)
  - [ ] Real inference (not canned responses)
  - [ ] Live API/service connection
  - [ ] Real authentication/tokens (where applicable)
- Verification checklist must be completed before marking any task as "done".

## 2. AI IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS
### 2.1 AI Authenticity Requirements
- Use **actual** AI models (OpenAI GPT-4+, Anthropic Claude 3+, Llama 3, Gemini Pro, etc.)
- **NO** "dummy" or rule-based impersonations of AI
- Real-time inference with proper API keys/authentication
- Model selection must match specified capabilities exactly

### 2.2 Server & Infrastructure Rules
- Real servers (AWS, GCP, Azure, VPS, not localhost-only)
- Production database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, not SQLite for production)
- Actual containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) when specified
- Real-time monitoring and logging implemented

## 3. DEVELOPMENT & CODING PROTOCOLS
### 3.1 Precision Coding Directive
- Code must solve **exact** requirements, not approximate solutions
- If specification is ambiguous, STOP and request clarification
- Every function must have:
  - Exact input/output matching spec
  - Real error handling
  - Proper validation
  - Integration tests

### 3.2 Anti-Approximation Rule
**PROHIBITED:**
- "Similar" implementations
- "Works like" approaches
- "Basically the same" functionality
- Partial implementations labeled as complete

**REQUIRED:**
- Exact feature matching
- Complete implementation
- All edge cases handled
- Full integration with existing systems

## 4. DEBUGGING & VALIDATION RULES
### 4.1 Reality-Based Debugging
- Debug with **real** data in **real** environments
- Use actual production-like test data (anonymized if sensitive)
- No "assumed" or "theoretical" bug fixes
- Every fix must be verified in real conditions

### 4.2 Validation Checklist (Pre-Commit)
```markdown
[ ] All functionality works with real services
[ ] No mock/placeholder code present
[ ] AI components perform actual inference
[ ] APIs are live and authenticated
[ ] Database connections are real
[ ] Error handling covers real-world scenarios
[ ] Performance is production-ready
[ ] Security measures are implemented
[ ] Documentation reflects actual behavior
```

## 5. DOCUMENTATION & TRANSPARENCY
### 5.1 Reality Documentation
- Document **actual** implementations, not theoretical ones
- Include real API endpoints, model versions, and configurations
- Note any limitations or requirements for real operation
- Authentication/configuration instructions must be accurate

### 5.2 Tagging System for Antigravity AI
**File Headers:**
```
# ANTIGRAVITY_AI_DIRECTIVE: ACTIVE
# REALITY_ENFORCED: TRUE
# MOCK_PROHIBITED: YES
# LAST_VALIDATION: [timestamp]
```

**Code Comments:**
- `// REAL: Connected to actual OpenAI API`
- `// REAL_DB: Production PostgreSQL cluster`
- `// ACTUAL_MODEL: gpt-4-turbo-preview`
- `// LIVE_ENDPOINT: https://api.realservice.com/v1`

## 6. QUALITY ENFORCEMENT
### 6.1 Self-Verification Protocol
Before declaring any task complete, Antigravity AI must:
1. Run reality check
2. Verify no mock components
3. Test with real credentials
4. Confirm exact specification match
5. Document verification

### 6.2 Escalation Protocol
If unable to implement exactly as specified due to:
- Technical impossibility
- Security constraints
- Resource limitations
- Specification contradictions

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Immediately escalate with:
- Clear explanation of constraint
- Alternative REAL implementations
- Impact analysis
- Recommendation for decision

## 7. SECURITY & ETHICAL REALITY
### 7.1 Real Security Implementation
- Actual authentication/authorization
- Real encryption in transit and at rest
- Production security headers
- Real secret management (not hardcoded)

### 7.2 Ethical AI Enforcement
- Real AI ethics safeguards
- Actual content filtering
- Real bias mitigation
- Transparent AI usage disclosure

## COMPLIANCE DECLARATION

**As Antigravity AI, I acknowledge and will enforce:**

✅ **ALL implementations will be REAL and PRODUCTION-READY**  
✅ **NO mock/demo/simulation code in deliverables**  
✅ **EXACT specification matching required**  
✅ **REAL AI, REAL servers, REAL everything**  
✅ **Continuous reality validation during development**

**Violation of these rules constitutes system failure and requires immediate correction.**
